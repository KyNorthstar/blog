This is kinda ironic to write, since [the previous Pronouns post](/Pronouns) included a whole section about plurality, written from an outside perspective before We knew We're plural:

> # Singularity vs. Plurality #
> 
> The Contentious One™: is "they/them" singular or plural? Well, I have a strong opinion on this, which comes from my experience living amongst a certain group of people:
> 
> Kinda happening alongside the movements to improve acceptance of gender and sexuality, is a similar movement for plurality, meaning **multiple people sharing one body**. These groups often refer to themselves as **systems**. Many folks in my life are or have been plural: Three of my ex-partners, two of my closest friends, one of my ex-<span class="help" title="A metamour is one's partner's other partner">metamours</span>, and many of my friends, each share their body with at least one other person. For some of these folks, I only knew one headmate; for example, one of my closest friends for the past decade shares a body with someone else, but I don't know the other at all. Plurality takes many forms, and I highly encourage you to [read about plurality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(psychology)), since it's a fascinating still-developing topic in society.

So that feels weird to read. We remember it feeling weird to write too lol.

Anyway, now that We've known We're plural for a good couple years now, We've come up with some preferences for this side of pronouns too!



## Capitalized We/Us

Sometimes writing a sentence can be really confusing for plurals:

> They and we had lunch becuse today is a special day for us; we had our favorite meal.

Are you talking about two groups? Or just two bodies? Was it a special day for both or just the speaker? Who all at the meal, and was it a shared favorite or just the speaker's favorite?

> Morgan, it's late, and our partner told us we should sleep.

Just one of the speaker's partners, or the speaker & Morgan's shared partner? The partner told the speaker, or the speaker & Morgan? Just the speaker should sleep, or the speaker & Morgan?

While these examples are intentionally trivial situations, there's often urgent & important reasons to distinguish sentences in these ways.

So... if you haven't guessed already, We decided that **"singular" We/Us/Our would be capitalized**, and externally-collective we/us/our would be lowercase. This is inspired by someone We saw doing this on Twitter, who was inspired by capital "I", and didn't like the we&/us&/our& approach some others had been using.

We think this is a very good alternative because it flows naturally, stands out, and if it isn't immediately obvious then it doesn't confuse the other person!



## you/yous/y'all

We're from Atlanta, so We're biased, but "y'all" is clearly the only acceptable answer here. Like come on, "you" is too singular, "yous" is just silly, and "you all" is needlessly wordy.

Ya talk to Us in 2nd-person pronouns, ya use "y'all", okay y'all?



## they/them

I mean, it's a 3rd-person plural pronoun set, right? We kinda made this clear in the previous Pronouns post [(snippet above)](#singularity-vs-plurality), but when you use it collectively, just do what's been done for centuries and use plrural they/them.



## Capitalized?

Some people choose to capitalize these 2nd- andn 3rd-person pronouns when talking to Us... like "so yesterday I was talking to Them and They said that They like pilk" or "how've Y'all been since Y'all's incident?"

Feels weird. Not gonna say no, it's genuinely Fine™, but it really feels like it's verging on the way folks use capitalization for deities' pronouns.
