You're about 12 years old going about your day at school. It's been rough so far, and all you want is a normal day without bullies messing with you too much.

Normal.

Now there's a word that's plagued you. You're never seen as normal. You.. don't feel so different, on the inside, so you don't get why everyone calls you a freak, a weirdo... crazy. Meanwhile they're the ones going out of their way to hurt a kid who's already feeling horrible every day.

As you're walking through a crowded hallway, parnoia seems to overtake you. Crowded hallways are where bad things happen... but there's no other way to class. Last time, someone spit gum into your hair. I would've been comedically cliché if it hadn't been the fifth time that day someone had destroyed your ability to think, to control, to be a student. Thoughts fly though your head, fears and fantasies of justice and escape. You don't believe any of them; they're just thoughts that happen in these situations... but they make it hard to control your real thoughts. It all just make you more and more tense.

Halfway down the hallway, you can make it if you just blend in and stay small. Your head flies forward, taking the rest of your body with it about when you feel and hear a basketball slam into you. They shout that fucking name at you, the one they call you, the one you try to forget. Everyone laughs, or at least it sounds like it. It even feels like they're laughing inside your head. It's not fair! Why you? What did you do to deserve this?

It's time someone made them pay. You're eating lunch, of course. It's okay, the same stuff they serve every week. You like the macaroni the best.

"So tomorrow, right?" your best friend asks. You look up at them, and blink. Tomorrow. Right, they asked to come over to play that new game you got. You nod, but can't summon the energy to smile.

What if you weren't alone in your head? It's a scary thought, isn't it? That someone else might be hearing your thoughts, teasing your behavior this way or that, controlling your body without you.

People living with DID and similar conditions experience this plurality. Of course, though, it's not like the movies. You might think of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly Multiple Personality Disorder) as "they might suddenly become a murderer" disorder because of how popular culture portrays being plural. Jekyll & Hyde, Banner & Hulk, Kevin Wendell Crumb & The Beast. Of course there's a broad spectrum of experiences to be sure, but mostly their daily struggles are with memory and task completion. Like nearly everyone else, they simply want to live a normal life.

Trauma is the primary way that this plurality manifests, as far as modern science can tell. A child in their most formative years, somewhere between 4 and 12 years old, experiences something that they can't live with... not alone, at least. Their only way to survive is to have help, and so they is joined by someone else in their head. A system of support forms internally, to make sure their shared body can survive.

This tends to come with some form of amnesia, where each person in the head struggles to (or cannot) remember what the other(s) did. This can lead to distress and confusion in everyday life. Some completely cannot remember what the others in their head did without them, and some can remember. Those who can tend to also struggle to remember things because those memories are scattered about their head, not immediately available.

Just like everyone, though, this becomes normalized to everyone in that head, and life goes on. They find a job, build a family, enjoy their hobbies, grieve losses, just like everyone else.

There are some who say that being plural is the default state of humans. It makes sense, given how it can arise from trauma. In fact, as far as modern science can tell, plurality like this is about as prevalent as red hair.

The weirdest thing about disordered plurality like DID is that it's what's known as a "covert" disorder. That is, the people living in the same head often aren't aware of the others, and have difficulty accepting their presence. The one most often in control (the host) might just say they has memory issues when folks tell them how they'd been acting out of character. They might shrug and say they have Borderline Personality Disorder or similar, and that's why they sometimes act so extremely different. They might just say they's quirky or weird.

It usually takes a big moment for the host to accept that they's in a system. Perhaps a decade of amnesia during which they find their name is changed and their presented identity doesn't align with their own internal identity. Perhaps they had been a kind and calm person for years, proud of how they'd gotten their emotions in-check, when suddenly an outburst happens that they know in the moment shouldn't happen, but they can't control their mouth or body and is just watching it do these things without them.

Whatever the reason, once the plural system is discovered, the path to mental health is clear: everyone in their head must learn to love and trust the rest. That means digging deep and addressing traumas, learning about each other, the differing perspectives and opinions, and how to cooperate and coordinate harmoniously.



## A Personal Story

### Part 1: An Outburst

In **January of 2022**, I had an outburst. **What follows is a real and personal story.**

I was stressed already from the day. Abuse followed by a missing girlfriend, followed by that girlfriend needing rescue but currently safe at a furmeet.

I drive the hour to that furmeet to find her enjoying games. I try to join, hoping to relieve the stress, while still suffering abuse over text messages. But I'm strong, and hide it. I put on jovial appearance and get to be known as a good jokester.

A friend of mine across the table started having a seizure. Nobody but I and his service dog notice. I'm experienced with seizures so I watch quietly to make sure he's alright. He soon comes out of it, and tries to say something, but everyone is too loud to hear what he's saying.

I ask people to be quiet. They don't quiet down.

I start to panic. I tell them to please shut up.

They laugh. They think this is part of the game we're playing; that I'm in character or something.

He's still trying to say something, but nobody will quiet down.

Suddenly, an outburst. I couldn’t stop it... I shout at everyone to be quiet. Some quiet down but some don't. I stand up, throw my mask off, and berate people for not letting me hear what he had to say. Everyone is quiet now. Someone looks like they’s about to speak, and I turn to them and say “When I say ‘shut up’, I meant it.” Throughout that whole thing, I desperately wanted to stop but couldn’t. I tried to stop shouting, stop saying those words, return to kindness... but it was like my body was being controlled by someone else. Like I was in the backseat of my own brain.

<!--It was a very stressful day. I had undergone some abuse over text messages, and was dealing with debilitating dread. It got to the point that I was screaming in the car about how horrible my life is, so loudly that it made me lightheaded, with tingly limbs.

Then I got home and my girlfriend wasn’t there. I panicked for a bit, before eventually discovering they’d quietly gone to a local meetup we’d heard of and wanted to attend. I was relieved until they texted me saying that they didn’t feel safe to come back, since they barely made it there on their motorcycle due to the cold. So I headed out to save them.

All the while the same abuse is continuing. I was dissociating from it a lot.

I get to the meetup and try to enjoy it. I meet people and play games, I joke, I start to make friends. The abuse continues. I'm on-edge. But I know myself, and my past; I'm very proud to have healed from the anger management struggles I had decades ago. I'm strong, kind, safe to be around. I've been through worse. It'll be okay.

The new friends come to know me as a lighthearted and jovial person, bringing humor and happiness to the meetup.

A friend of mine at the meet has a seizure.

I'm experienced with this so I just watch quietly to make sure they’s alright. Their service dog tries to get folks' attention, but they don't understand or don't notice. They soon comes out of it, and they’s trying to say something. Everyone is too loud.

I ask people to be quiet. They don't quiet down.

I start to panic. I tell them to please shut up.

They laugh. They think this is part of the game we're playing; that I'm in character or something.

The friend is still trying to say something, but nobody will quiet down.
-->

The person I directly shouted at was triggered and walked out of the building. Long story short, I found them and apologized, and they forgave me.

I couldn’t understand what happened. It caught me completely off-guard, acting that way. I thought I was incapable of that kind of thing, that I'd learned over a decade ago to control my anger. I had built my internal and external identity as someone who is kind and jovial, never angry, always safe. I didn’t know what to think...

So I drove my girlfriend home and I swore off ever going back to the meetup until I could understand what happened.


### Part 2: Meditation & Suppurt

The next day, I talked about this to a friend who's a bit of a spiritual leader. They gave me a meditation to try out, and so I did it every night. The idea is to pull oneself away from one's body, to have some external perspective and see if that helps one understand oneself more intimately. Every night I pulled back, and stayed like that for a bit. Sometimes observing my separated self, sometimes just returning back to my body, sometimes falling asleep like that.

I did this every night for a few weeks. Meanwhile, one of my partners told me they're a plural system. In a wave of love and care, I dived into research. I joined DID and OSDD communities trying to learn how to support her. I learned about their experiences, what it's like to not be alone in one's head.

As I read the accounts, as I talked to the folks in those communities... I kept waiting for the part that sounded foreign, that wasn't in my experience... but it never came. It was all familiar. It was all me.

In late February, while pulling back, I had this epiphany. A lot of those experiences of plurality... applied to me. I thought back through my life, and I was able to identify moments when I wasn't acting like myself, when I had gaps in my memory, when I felt like I was on autopilot. These experiences they described were how I felt when I got angry, and when I'm scared I might be abused... and when I'm concentrating on something very dangerous or otherwise exceptionally engaging.

I meditated on this concept, alone in my room. And... it felt like being seen for the first time, but I wasn't the one feeling that. Someone else was feeling that, within my head. I meditated on that more over the next day, and
