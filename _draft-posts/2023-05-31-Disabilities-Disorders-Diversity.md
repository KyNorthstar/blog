A disability is when someone's abilities are diminished in a way that makes them less capable than someone else. Most commonly, people think of someone who has lost a limb or similar. This does not need to be permanent, however; tor example, if you have a stuffy nose, then you're momentarily disabled because you lack the ability to smell things.

A disorder is when someone's life cannot be orderly due to an internal involuntary condition.
