```swift
let example = "this"
```

We genuinely love [Markdown]! It's proven very good over the past 20 years, and in those years we've seen some shortcomings. So, We came up with this alternative, MarKy.

The core concept is the same as Markdown: Use some easily-human-read plaintext minimal markup to create a rich text file which can still be easily ready by anyone even if it's not converted into rich text.


<pre data-lang="MarKy">
**bold**

//italic//

__underline__

~~strikethrough~~

``monospace``

```
generic code block
```

```lang
Auto-language-formatted code block
```
