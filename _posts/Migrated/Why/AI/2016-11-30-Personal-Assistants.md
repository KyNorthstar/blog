	<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/" target="_blank">Siri</a>, <a href="https://assistant.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Assistant</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/" target="_blank">Cortana</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011&ref_=fs_ods_fs_aucc_cp" target="_blank">Alexa</a>, etc.. The generic term is "personal assistants," but that's just a metaphor, like
	"virtual reality". In my opinion, a personal assistant, human or otherwise, must be able to do hear and form a
	respone to the following in a reasonable amount of time:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>"Where did I save that podcast I started listening to yesterday?"</li>
			<li>"Who was I going to call?"</li>
			<li>"Call them and ask for a refund."</li>
			<li>"Send Chris this photo via Hangouts."</li>
			<li>"Turn on my desktop and send me the Excel version of this Google Sheet that I'd saved on it."</li>
		</ul>
