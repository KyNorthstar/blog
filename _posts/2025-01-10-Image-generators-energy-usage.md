> AI is killing the environment because it takes so much energy to generate its output
{:.big}

If you have heard or said something similar to this, did you challenge it? Did you investigate this claim to see how true it really is?

I know that every time I hear a broad, too-good/bad-to-be-true claim, I look into it, and I know I'm not the only one. Here's an example [from Tumblr user txttletale](https://txttletale.tumblr.com/post/754458054203965440/i-for-one-get-a-lot-of-joy-from-asking-bing-ai-to). This example was brought to me by a friend, and I don't know nor endorse anyone in this screenshot:

<figure markdown=1>
[![A tumblr post with the following conversation:
txttletale:
its very funny when people talk at length about the horrible environmental impact of ai and give a big scary sounding number of electricty or litres of water or datacenter floor space without any context and then you investigate what that number means contextually and it always like pales in comparison to what's used by like. online gaming
txttletale:
this is less a comment on ai art per se and more on how you should be skeptical of any number (or percentage!) given to you that you have no context for
waltermeadows:
I just happen to think that online gaming is (sometimes) a positive addition to our world and things like crypto and ai are just a net loss and devoting planet-destroying energy to things that are actively harmful is a damn travesty
txttletale:
this is such a funny argument lol. our noble and socially necessary fortnite servers vs. their evil wasteful midjourney servers
loserfag-deactivated20240701:
Imagine being so retarded you don’t understand the simple concept of something being used for joy, a hobby or pastime being okay compared to something being used for literal shit
txttletale:
i for one get a lot of joy from asking bing ai to generate ‘lightning mcqueen gulf war campaign memorabilia’

As much as I don't really wanna write about Fortnite, it does happen to be a good example here because it's currently a notably-popular online game at time of writing, and we are trying our best to compare apples to apples here.

So, with that said, let's do some research and crunch these numbers!



## Your Device's Base Power Usage

The one you're using right now! Probably a smartphone or laptop or something like that.
It's using electricity to do everything it does.
**Understanding exactly how much energy it uses helps us set a baseline for what to expect throughout the rest of this.**

The type of device varies wildly, ranging from power-sipping watches to massive gaming rigs & servers, so let's get some reasonable (and charitable) expectations set.

I'll assume you're using a common new smartphone/laptop/desktop. I'll only look at the top sellers, too, to get the most-general stats.

That's... a very wide range. You're definitely not using at 100% all the time, so I'll be reasonable and say it's probably somewhere in the middle. **Let's go with what that iMac uses at idle**:

Much more workable. Let's continue!



## The Energy Usage of a Human Body

Yes, I actually am going here.

Don't worry; I'm not going to start taking into account how much energy it takes to grow your food or air-condition the room you're in or whatever. Let's pretend you're sitting outside on a perfectly comfortable day, in the shade so your device is comfortable too, and your nutrition is 100% renewable.<!-- Using the word "renewable" here to hopefully get readers to think about how renewability changes how they think about this. --> No energy to account for outside you and your device.

Now. It takes less energy for a human to type a prompt into the text field of an image generator, than it does for that same human to play an hour of a twitch-response multiplayer game like Fortnite.

I found [a website][Calories Burned Playing Video Games] which attempts to give estimates for Kilocalories burned by playing video games, above the base KCals that humans burn just existing. The thing is, this website focuses on "traditional video game" versus video games designed to promote fitness, like Wii Fit and DDR.

Well that isn't exactly what we're looknng for...

Alright, let's make an educated guess and assume a 1-hour Fortnite session is comparable to a light-to-moderate 15-minute Wii Fit session. Using a body mass of 150lbs (68 Kg), splitting the difference between a light Wii Fit session (165 KCal) and a moderate one (272 KCal), that's something like **219 KCal** above human base. That works out to:

## The Energy Usage of Online Gaming

The Tumblr post at the top of this blogpost seems concerned with comparing image generation to online gaming (and specifically mentions Fortnite).

Well there's 2 components to this: the players' devices and the server they're connecting to, so let's dig in.



### 1: Your Device Running a Video Game

There's a wide range of possible games your computer can play; everything from Solitaire and Minecraft to Cyberpunk 2077 and Dying Light 2. So I gotta focus somewhere or this is a nothing-question.

Let's look specifically at [Unreal Engine]: one of the more popular ones for big-name games, including Fortnite.

I found [a paper from February 2023][Reducing Fortnite’s Power Consumption] about Epic Games trying to make the Unreal Engine game Fortnite more energy-efficient. What a coincidence!

According to that paper, after their improvements to client-side energy efficiency, it takes an Xbox Series X **~168 Watts** to play Fortnite.

<aside>Unhelpfully, this paper almost entirely talks about ratios between previous usage and usage after their changes, without citing what either was, so I had to guesstimate this number from the "Average power consumption" graph.</aside>

And according to [this webpage][Fortnite weekly usage], the average active Fortnite player spends 6~10hrs per week playing the game. If you put those together, then for a single player's device running Fortnite, that works out to:

<div class="flex-row flex-wrap">
  <figure class="energy-usage card">
    <b>
      {%- capture energyUsage-fortnite-client-perSession %}
        {%- include energy-units.html
          joules='604.8 kJ'
          watt-hours='168Wh'
          gasoline='3.83 tsp'
        %}
      {%- endcapture %}
      {{- energyUsage-fortnite-client-perSession -}}
    </b>
    <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per player per session</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="energy-usage card">
    <b>
      {%- capture energyUsage-fortnite-client-perWeek %}
        {%- include energy-units.html
          joules='3.63 ~ 6.05 MJ'
          watt-hours='1.01 ~ 1.68 kWh'
          gasoline='0.48 ~ 0.80 cups'
        %}
      {%- endcapture %}
      {{- energyUsage-fortnite-client-perWeek -}}
    </b>
    <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per player per per Week</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

But remember, this isn't nearly the whole story for playing such an online game. You have to think about the game servers too!


### 2: A Server Running an MMO

Now that's a term that doesn't get thrown around much anymore, huh? Massively-Multiplayer Online (game). Basically fell out of favor once World of Warcraft wasn't the biggest member of this genre.

Well, turns out basically every online game can be called an MMO now so let's look at how much energy a modern MMO uses up.

I had to crunch a few sources for this one:

- Serverwatch's [Server room power consumption]
- Fortnite.gg's [Fortnite player count]
- MMOStats'... [MMO stats][MMOStats]
- ZDNet's [Calculate datacenter server power usage]
- ESTNN's [Fortnite Servers – All 8 Locations and Why Ping is Important]
- and a few others that aren't as critical

So the basic thing you need to know is that video game servers are usually pretty generic these days. A video game company like Epic pays a server hosing company like AWS to host it for them... So we'll be looking at some generic numbers here.

{%- capture energyUsage-fortnite-serverTotal-perSession %}
{%- include energy-units.html
  joules='1.8 MJ'
  watt-hours='500 Wh'
  gasoline='11.39 tsp'
%}
{%- endcapture %}

Being charitable and **assuming they're really efficient**, we can say that one server uses {{ energyUsage-fortnite-serverTotal-perSession }} for a 1-hour Fortnite session. But remember, we're just looking at 1 person playing 1 game of Fortnite on 1 server, so we have to figure out how to divide that up.

At time of writing, the 24-hour peak Fortnite player count is 1,829,292 concurrent players. Since there's 8 Fortnite server locations (let's pretend each location is just 1 physical server so we don't lose our minds in the weeds), that's about 228,661 players per server. So dividing up {{ energyUsage-fortnite-serverTotal-perSession }} across 228,661 players finally gets us:

<div class="flex-row flex-wrap">
  <figure class="energy-usage card">
    <b>
      {%- capture energyUsage-fortnite-server-perSession %}
        {%- include energy-units.html
          joules='7.87 J'
          watt-hours='2.18 mWh'
          gasoline='0.25 μL'
        %}
      {%- endcapture %}
      {{- energyUsage-fortnite-server-perSession -}}
    </b>
    <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per player per session</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <figure class="energy-usage card">
      <b>
        {%- capture energyUsage-fortnite-server-perWeek %}
          {%- include energy-units.html
            joules='47.22 ~ 78.70 J'
            watt-hours='13.08 ~ 21.80 mWh'
            gasoline='1.47 ~ 2.46 μL'
          %}
        {%- endcapture %}
        {{- energyUsage-fortnite-server-perWeek -}}
      </b>
      <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per player per week</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

Which is delightfully low! **Well done, Fortnite!**

But... there's 1 more energy component here we've yet to consider.



## The Energy Usage of Image Generators

I would love to investigate how much energy something like [DALL-E] uses, but sadly it's all proprietary and operated behind closed doors, so I can't really figure that one out.

However, [Stable Diffusion] is open-source and freely available to download and inspect, so I'll look at that!

Just like video games, it depends on the hardware you use. Thankfully, I found [a paper from June 2024][Power Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?] which looks into things like this, using a node of 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs hosted on Amazon Web Services. On page 6, it says that Stable Diffusion (among others) takes a mean of {% include energy-units.html
  joules='10.465 MJ'
  watt-hours='2.907 kWh'
  gasoline='66.25 tsp'
%} and a median of {% include energy-units.html
  joules='4.86 MJ'
  watt-hours='1.35 kWh'
  gasoline='30.77 tsp'
%} to generate **1,000** images. Looking only at the median, that's:

<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <b>
    {%- capture energyUsage-generate1Image %}
      {%- include energy-units.html
        joules='4.86 kJ'
        watt-hours='1.35 Wh'
        gasoline='0.03 tsp'
      %}
    {%- endcapture %}
    {{- energyUsage-generate1Image -}}
    </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per image</figcaption>
</figure>
{%- capture energyUsage-generate8Images %}
  {%- include energy-units.html
    joules='38.88 kJ'
    watt-hours='10.80 Wh'
    gasoline='0.25 tsp'
  %}
{%- endcapture %}

Now to figure out how much energy it takes for _you_ to generate 8 images, we add in your device and your body. Why 8? Well, most image generators give batches of 4 or so images so I'm being charitable and imagining you try twice to get the perfect image. Assuming it takes 1 minute for the whole process, we can add up the energy taken for you to type it in (**{{- energyUsage-humanBody-1KCal -}}**) and wait for all 8 results (**{{- energyUsage-generate8Images -}}**), and run that iMac I mentioned above which uses **{{ energyUsage-averageDevice-perMinute }}** per minute, that's:

<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <!--
    energy=8images+typing+device
    joules=33.88kJ+4.19KJ+160J
    watt-hours=10.80Wh+1.16Wh+44.67mWh
    gasoline=0.25tsp+0.03tsp+296μL
    -->
    <b>
      {%- capture energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead %}
        {%- include energy-units.html
          joules='38.23 kJ'
          watt-hours='12.00 Wh'
          gasoline='0.34 tsp'
        %}
      {%- endcapture %}
      {{- energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead -}}
    </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">for 1 person to generate <strong>8</strong> images</figcaption>
</figure>



## Putting These Together

Seems we have everything we need to make a conclusion!

To recap, a single person's Fortnite session takes **{{ energyUsage-fortnite-client-perSession }}** for the client, **{{ energyUsage-fortnite-server-perSession }}** for the server, and **{{ energyUsage-humanBody-fortniteSession }}** for the human; whereas generating **8** image takes **{{ energyUsage-generate8Images }}**, and we're saying you're using that iMac which uses **{{ energyUsage-averageDevice-perMinute }}** per minute, and it takes you 1 minute to generate 8 images, and **{{ energyUsage-humanBody-1KCal }}** to hammer in the prompt.

Adding those together and making sure we use the same units for both, drumroll please:

<div class="flex-row flex-wrap">
  <figure class="energy-usage card">
    <b>{% include energy-units.html
      joules='1.522 MJ'
      watt-hours='422.89 Wh'
      gasoline='9.64 tsp'
    %}</b>
    <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per Fortnite session</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="energy-usage card">
    <b>{{ energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead }}</b>
    <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">per 8 generated images</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<!--
Fortnite / Generator:
  1.522MJ / 38.23kJ = 103.82
-->

So we can finally say:


<figure class="big energy-usage card">
    <span class="specifier">Fortnite takes</span>
    <b>24×</b>
    <figcaption class="specifier">more energy than image generators</figcaption>
    <aside><strong>1</strong> Fortnite session vs generating <strong>8</strong> images</aside>
</figure>

That means the energy it takes to play 1 Fortnite session could generate **~230 images!**



<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD025 -->

# Just Commission An Artist!

So maybe that all leaves a sour taste in your mouth. To heck with image generators! You're just gonna have an artist make the image for you.

Well we already know how much energy their device would be using. We're still assuming they're using that one iMac. Now we just have to figure out:

1. How much energy does it take to draw an art commission?
2. How much energy do drawing programs use?
3. How long does it take to draw an art commission, on average?

For this one, I'll just say that #3 is "1 hour", because that seems very charitable and reasonable for these estiamtes. If the average is longer than that, then so be it, but I can't imagine it's shorter.



## Back To Measuring A Human Body

How much energy does an artist's body use while drawing? It's surely more than typing a prompt, but less than twitch-response gaming.
[According to Scientific American][Scientific American: Does Thinking Really Hard Burn More Calories?], although mental effort _does_ increase exhaustion, it _doesn't_ notably affect calories burned. So, we'll only be looking at how much their body is moving.

Let's assume the artist is doing traditional painting-style art. Brush on canvas, stylus on tablet, etc.. [According to Drawing Wars][Drawing Wars: Does Painting Burn Calories?], that's about 180 KCal per hour. I'll take their word for that!

<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <b>
    {%- capture energyUsage-humanBody-drawingArt %}
      {%- include energy-units.html
        joules='754.2 kJ'
        watt-hours='209.5 Wh'
        gasoline='4.77 tsp'
      %}
    {%- endcapture %}
    {{- energyUsage-humanBody-drawingArt -}}
    </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">drawing art for 1 hour</figcaption>
</figure>



## Energy Usage of an Art Program

We measured how much energy a latent-diffusion image generator uses, so now let's see how much energy a drawing program uses.

To be honest, it's no surprise that nobody has ever measured this (please let me know if I'm wrong, but I can't find any such measurements).

However, it's [well-known](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/photoshop-23-5-high-cpu-usage/td-p/13148964) [that Photoshop](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/photoshop-using-significant-energy-while-closed-macbook-pro-m1/td-p/14537085) [uses a lot](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/adobe-photoshop-not-responding-very-high-power-usage/td-p/12129227) [of energy](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/newer-photoshop-version-draining-battery-high-wattage-usage-any-tips/m-p/14506296). So let's look back at the section about energy usage of video games. I'll take the measurement of Unreal Engine we used earlier since they did work to make that more efficient, and say it uses **~168 Watts**, meaning:


<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <b>
    {%- capture energyUsage-photoshop-perHour %}
      {{- energyUsage-fortnite-client-perSession -}}
    {%- endcapture %}
    {{- energyUsage-photoshop-perHour -}}
  </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">To use Photoshop for 1 hour. <br/>Probably. Maybe.</figcaption>
</figure>



## Putting These Together

To make things easier on ourselves, let's say that this artist always takes exactly 1 hour to draw the art, and that your request was just sending them a single sentence over text (**{{ energyUsage-humanBody-1KCal }}**), and assuming the artist is using Photoshop at about the same power usage as Fortnite (**{{ energyUsage-photoshop-perHour }}**), and that they're doing this for free. So we have our numbers!

Adding these up, we get:

<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <b>
    <!--
          artist body:  754.20 kJ
          art program:  604.80 kJ
    commissioner body: +  4.19 kJ

                total: 1363.19 kJ
    -->
    {%- capture energyUsage-commissionArtist %}
      {%- include energy-units.html
        joules='1.36 MJ'
        watt-hours='377.8 Wh'
        gasoline='8.61 tsp'
      %}
    {%- endcapture %}
    {{- energyUsage-commissionArtist -}}
    </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">to commission an artist for 1 image</figcaption>
</figure>

Since it takes {{ energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead }} to generate 8 images, we can say:

<figure class="big energy-usage card">
    <span class="specifier">Commissioning an artist takes about</span>
    <b>24×</b>
    <figcaption class="specifier">more energy than image generators</figcaption>
    <aside>Commissioning <strong>1</strong> artwork vs generating <strong>8</strong> images</aside>
</figure>

That's about the energy it takes to **generate ~205 images!**





# Just google a real image!

Well, if you don't like that it takes {{ energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead }} to generate an image or {{ energyUsage-commissionArtist }} to commission one, maybe you should Google existing images instead!

{%- capture energyUsage-googleSearch-2009 %}
  {%- include energy-units.html
    joules='1.08 kJ'
    watt-hours='0.3 Wh'
    gasoline='33.7 µL'
  %}
{%- endcapture %}
{%- capture energyUsage-googleSearch-2019 %}
  {%- include energy-units.html
    joules='36 kJ'
    watt-hours='10 Wh'
    gasoline='0.23 tsp'
  %}
{%- endcapture %}

[According to Google][Google: Powering a Google Search], a Google search in 2009 took about **{{ energyUsage-googleSearch-2009 }}** of energy.
[A 2019 article by Full Fact][Full Fact: How energy intensive is a Google search?] discusses a claim by The Times that a single Google search takes enough energy to "power a low-energy light bulb for an hour", which the article then goes on to interpret as about **{{ energyUsage-googleSearch-2019 }}**.

Assuming that all the fancy info cards and such increased each Google search's energy usage since 2009, I'll go with the newer & higher figure. I'll also ignore the [AI Overview bullshit][Google is Smart] because it's not really useful and complicates these calculations.

So assuming you have a browser sortcut to directly search images.google.com and that uses **{{ energyUsage-googleSearch-2019 }}**, and it takes you 1 minute to find the image you want (and you don't have to do a second search), and you're using that iMac from earlier which uses **{{ energyUsage-averageDevice-perMinute }}** per minute, and you spend 1KCal (**{{- energyUsage-humanBody-1KCal -}}**) to type in the search query, and you're using Magical Internet that takes zero energy to transmit data:

<figure class="energy-usage card">
  <!--
  image search:  36.00 kJ
        device: 160.00 J
          body:   4.19 kJ

  -->
  <b>
    {%- capture energyUsage-googleSearch-2019-plusOverhead %}
      {%- include energy-units.html
        joules='40.35 kJ'
        watt-hours='11.21 Wh'
        gasoline='0.26 tsp'
      %}
    {%- endcapture %}
    {{- energyUsage-googleSearch-2019-plusOverhead -}}
  </b>
  <figcaption role="aside" class="specifier">to find 1 image on Google</figcaption>
</figure>

Which, when compared to generating **8** images taking {{ energyUsage-generate8Images-plusOverhead }}, we get:

<figure class="big energy-usage card">
    <span class="specifier">Googling takes about</span>
    <b>0.9×</b>
    <span class="specifier">the energy of image generators</span>
    <aside>Googling <strong>1</strong> image vs generating <strong>8</strong> images</aside>
</figure>

We've finally found something comparable! Googling an image takes about the same amount of energy as generating images! Assuming it still uses the same amount of energy to do a Google search as it did in 2019.

Nowhere near the difference we saw with comparing to Fortnite or artists, but we all expected that a single Google search takes less energy than those.






# But Wait, The Training Tho!

Ahhhh, if you thought this, I commend you. Training an image generator is a significant amount of energy that shouldn't be discounted.

Luckily, [that first paper I mentioned][Power Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?] also discusses the energy costs of training image generators!

The paper focuses on [BLOOMz]. According to that paper, the power used highly depends on the size of model you're training:

{{ energyUnit-gigajoules }}! Now that's a whole SI prefix more than before! And that's not even counting the human cost, which... I'll just say is difficult enough to calculate that even I won't be estimating it today.


To properly compare this, though, we would have to look at how much energy it takes to create a game like Fortnite, a program like Photoshop, or a service like Google Search.



## The energy usage of industry-scale software development

... okay, I'm not _that_ crazy. I definitely don't currently have the energy/time to figure this out. (How much energy to power a floor of an office building? How many employees' workstations? How long do they work? Do you count all versions together or just the current one? If just the current one, how do you account for all the work that went into making the code it updates? etc.)

If you've read what came before in this article, then you should already guess that will also be on the order of {{ energyUnit-gigajoules }}, most likely more than making an image generator.

<!-- TODO: Maybe actually look into this tho 👀 -->




# For comparison

To wrap up this article, let's take a look at some more things that are measured in {{ energyUnit-gigajoules }}:

# The Meta

I spent about **76 hours** total writing this article. Well, probably more since I started 2024-07-05, but I don't want to think about that lol...

I also used various search engines to find the **47+ Internet sources** linked in this article. I feel like my median search probably required **~3 searches per source** so we'll say I performed the equivalent of **140 Google searches**.

I'm gonna ignore how much energy each of those sites takes, all the editing software, the server software, my Intel MacBook Pro's energy usage, the energy usages of my house and office, the browser I use and its dev tools, searching to resolve bugs in the code, generally updating the rest of this site while I think about this, performing the calculations, the many Telegram discussions with friends, septuple-checking the math...<br/>
I'll just look at the high-level view of how much energy _just the research_ for this blogpost took:

<figure class="energy-usage card">
    <span class="specifier">This article took at least</span>
    <b>{% include energy-units.html
      joules='6.70 ~ 7.86 MJ'
      watt-hours='1.86 ~ 2.18 kWh'
      gasoline='42.42 ~ 49.77 tsp'
    %}</b>
    <span class="specifier">to research this article</span>
    <aside>Typing & using device for ~76 hours + ~140 Google searches</aside>
</figure>

Which is about 76 ~ 182× the energy of generating 8 images, with the median being:

<figure class="big energy-usage card">
    <span class="specifier">Researching this article took at least</span>
    <b>122×</b>
    <span class="specifier">more energy than generating <strong>8</strong> images</span>
</figure>

That's more than generating 1,000 images! 🤯






## Calculations

Many of these calculations were performed in [a Google Sheets spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPgkdUFNOWTBiRVHruVnlvhU4-oLUSI-YSKGrREX_Xk/edit?usp=sharing) along with some help from [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%281266.667+kWh+%2F+33.7kWh%29+*+1+gallon+to+tsp) to check the math.
