Hope you've read [the previous blog post](/More-than-one) already. If not, please do that now because... you'll need it for context.

Now, as for the absense, you deserve an explanation, even if you don't come around here much.

Assuming you've indeed read the previous blog post, you'll understand the phrase "plurality is fucking weird". We'd been plural Our whole conscious life, but only truly realized it in early 2022, just a month after We turned 31. There are some [funny scenarios](#funny-scenarios) which happened because of that, but also some [very emotionally difficult ones](#ego-death).


## Ego Death

We'd like to tell a story. It might sound terrifying, but honestly every single one of Us is happy it happened, even though it was very difficult to experience in the moment.


#### Initial processing

One thing We don't talk about much is how the early days affected Arx (the subsystem which represents the core hosts of our system: just Ash, Rayne, and Dax at the time)

**Dax and Rayne** were the main fronters when We discovered the system, but they couldn't tell each other apart because their differences are very subtle. They genuinely believed they were the same person for months, in the same way that We all genuinely believed We were the same person until system discovery in early 2022. The two of them called themselves Ky at that point. The host Ky and the alters.

In the first two weeks after discovery, they took quite a few moments to themselves to just... sit, and accept that they were never a singlet, and that there's no "going back" because there's no "back" to go to, and that throughout their life they've never had complete control of what they thought was their own body.

They had to rewrite everything they knew about themselves. Starting with the basic "it's not my life; it's Our life. It's not my body; it's Our body," etc.
When they got to realizing "I've never been the only one in control, and I cannot live that life," that's when it hit hardest.
They repeated it for weeks. In their head and out loud. Over, and over again.

The concept they had in their head for decades of "this is me"... that concept had to die to move forward. And so it did. **Ego death.**


#### Klones

Dax and Rayne, still genuinely believing themselves to be the same person, eventually came to accept this new reality, thinking "I've never been alone in my body, but I have always been the primary one in control."

Then **Ash** came out of dormancy in the March of 2022. His first thought was "I'm like Ky, but... I'm a dude."

We all grappled with what that meant, including himself. His last memory of his own before dormancy was in August 2020, so We figured he had something to do with the trauma that COVID-19, financial hardships, and relationship issues brought that year. Maybe he was created to hold all that trauma and be locked away. This didn't explain why he seemed so similar to "Ky", but they didn't think about it. 

In an April trauma event that same year, **Eevie** was created. She seemed very similar to "Ky" and Ash. They joked that "Ash, Eevie, and Ky are so similar that it's like they are clones of each other. Ky clones! The Klones!" It was a way to celebrate that likeness, but in the back of Our head, We wondered why that was.


#### Piecing it apart

We think it was in June that We finally realized (admitted) **Rayne** wasn't the same person as **Dax**.
Rayne... had trouble accepting this separation. They didn't want to exist, because their existence at that time was pain. Depression, anxiety, & self-hate. They didn't want that to be all they was; to be so much for one alter. But eventually they accepted it.

Dax still called themself "Ky", but at least We had finally narrowed that name down to a singular person. "Ky", the one host of the system who has been the primary one in control of it for most of its life.

And so We thought about all this and pondered it. We realized that Rayne joined in middle school, from the trauma encted by Our religious leaders at the time repeatedly drilling into Our head that We weren't worth the space We took up.

We discovered **Chris** around this time. Another Klone, meaning he felt very similar to Dax, Rayne, Ash, and Eevie. Like Ash, it was apparent he'd been around for years at the very least. The only difference is that Chris han't been dormant for years like Ash had; he seemed to have been around consistently this whole time.

And that got Us thinking more and more about things until We realized that _Ash_ was the original host, and that _Dax_ was the one who joined the system in 2020 because Ash couldn't handle it and had to go dormant.

The concept they had in their head for decades of "this is me"... that concept had to die to move forward. And so it did. **Ego death.**


#### Hostless

We started thinking about the Klones. Why were they all so similar? It dawned on Us that each of them could easily take on daily activities like a host, even though We thought Dax (then still called "Ky") was the one and only host. But We knew they couldn't be the only host because they came about in 2020. It dawned on Us that there was no true host, and that the title gets passed around.

Around this time, it started to become obvious to Us that there was no alter who could be thought of as "Ky"... not really. What We thought was that original host with the biggest claim to the body, was actually an alter created 2 years ago; it was just a coincidence that they was the current host when the system was discovered. The actual original host seems to have been Ash, who'd been dormant on-and-off throughout Our collective life.

Turns out, that's what the Klones are: every time the current host can't handle life, another host takes over who specializes in the current problems life is throwing at Us. Ash, Rayne, Chris, Dax, Eevie. All equally hosts.

Ash, Rayne, & Dax felt especially similar. They discovered that together they're a subsystem of the Klones, specifically designed to be the core of the system, the default, best public mask.

Around this time, Dax chose their new name, meaning **no one alter was Ky. We are all equally Ky.**

The concept We had in Our head for decades of "this is me"... that concept had to die to move forward. And so it did. **Ego death.**


#### ðŸ’– It's okay

Aight so We know that's... _a lot_ to take in. You might be feeling sympathetic for Us, or maybe even some existencial feelings of your own. Rest assured that We're okay (in fact, We're much better than before all this), and if something similar happens with you, you'll probably be okay or better on the other side of it too.

If you want to chat with Us about this or anything else, We'd be happy to. We prefer Telegram, but you can find all Our contact info on Our homepage: [KyLeggiero.me](https://KyLeggiero.me)
