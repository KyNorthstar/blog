Scripts specific to this blog!

We would prefer to put these into [the BHStudios `scripts` repo](https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/scripts), but We've since lost the ability to transform Kotlin into JS, so We're gonna have to rewrite all that in JS someday. That means a complete restructuring of that repo, which will take awhile.

Until then, any changes We need to make for this repo, are placed here until they can be moved to that one.
